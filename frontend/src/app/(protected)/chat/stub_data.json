As  the  slight  deviation  matures,  progressive  nasal obstruction and deformity occur. A child's nose differs from that of an adult in several ways. Specifi  cally, the underdeveloped nose has less frontal projection, is largely composed of cartilage,  and  possesses  several  growth  centers.  As  a  result, pediatric nasal trauma often presents a unique diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. The immature nose is more likely to be associated with other fractures of the face because the nasal projection is much less prominent. Since the child's nose is more cartilaginous than its adult counterpart, it is easily compressible and absorbs little of the energy from the striking force as it passes across the face. The resultant edema spreads over the face and tends to disguise the extent of the nasal involvement in the pediatric age group.\nThe pediatric patient is likely to be uncooperative and an exacting examination may not be possible. Extensive edema with facial trauma and the lack of rigidity of the nasal skeleton tend to produce a less than optimal situation for evaluation, even in the cooperative patient. The cartilaginous structures of the nose tend to buckle and twist with the trauma rather than to fracture.", "book_name": "Fonseca ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL - Volume II", "page_number": "294", "id": 7}, {"page_content": "The nasal aperture and nasal tip soft tissue laceration will be most revealing in terms of scarring secondary to the thick, underlying dermis. The most important physiologic anatomy of the nose is the nasal aperture, which, with alterations in its size, can cause decreased nasal air fl  ow and increased airway resistance, creating problems with breathing. Therefore repairs that return the nasal aperture to its original size and symmetry are paramount if at all possible  (Figure 18-4). 4\nAvulsion type hard and soft tissue injuries need evaluation and  treatment  while  the  patient  is  sedated  with  a  general anesthetic.  Secondary  reconstructive  touch-up  procedures should be anticipated (Figure 18-5).\nBecause of bony remodeling and soft tissue scarring, clinicians should expect to reconstruct a small percentage of nasal injuries secondarily if the patient desires. The most common causes  of  this  need  for  revision  are  patient  noncompliance (such as sleep posture), the general cantilever-like instability of the nasal prominence itself, or the type and nature of the injury  (Figure 18-6). The clinician should remember to eval5 uate contiguous structure involvement such as medial canthal attachment, lacrimal sacs, outfl  ow tracks, and sinus involvement, all of which are housed within the nasal compartment (Figure  18-7).  Turbinates,  if  necessary,  can  be  partially  or completely sacrifi  ced.\nRemember  that  the  dorsum  follows  the  septum  and  the nose is one-third bone to two-thirds soft tissue, especially in children.  The septum, including both the quadrate cartilage 6 anteriorly and the vomerine process more posteriorly, needs to be reduced or 'snapped back' on top of the palatal crest.

Many options exist, as do many fi  llers, many substances, many materials, and many claims of superiority. This chapter cannot cover  all  available  fi  llers  in  depth  and  will  concentrate  on those  commonly  used  (or  soon  to  be  released  for  use).  As stated  earlier, bovine  collagen  (Zyplast,  Zyderm;  Inamed Corp., Santa Barbara, Calif) dominated the U.S. market for longer  than  2  decades.  These  fi  llers  contained  lidocaine, which  mitigated  the  discomfort  of  the  injection  process. Because  these  products  were  of  bovine  derivation,  allergy testing was a prerequisite. Classically, patients were inoculated in  the  forearm  with  the  material,  and,  if  no  local  allergic response was seen after 30 days, the material was assumed to be safe. Some practitioners advocated two successive monthly negative allergy tests. The need for testing proved to be a great drawback because many cosmetic consumers are spontaneous and want immediate treatment.", "book_name": "Fonseca ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL - Volume III", "page_number": "641", "id": 8}], "answer": "According to CHUNK 1, most common fillers are placed intradermally. This is shown in Figure 29-5, which illustrates the approximate intended target for filler injection. Although the question specifically asks about bovine collagen, which is not mentioned in the provided context, general principles of filler injection apply. Bovine collagen, like other fillers, would be most effectively placed in the dermal layer to achieve optimal results for lip augmentation. Therefore, the correct answer is dermal, as it aligns with the general principle of filler placement discussed in the context."}, {"question": "Restylane (injectable hyaluronic acid):", "question_type": "Aesthetic", "chunks": [{"page_content": "A foreign invasion of injectable fi  llers has occurred since December 2003. At the end of 2003, Restylane (hyaluronic acid; Qmed, Uppsala, Sweden), which has been used in many countries  for  over  a  decade,  received  U.S.  Food  and  Drug Administration (FDA)  approval.  This marketing release brought  an  onslaught  of  media  attention  that  boosted  the entire perception of and desire for fi  llers by aging baby boomers. Restylane changed the paradigm in this country for injectable fillers for numerous reasons. First, it is a non-animal product synthesized from bacteria. Hyaluronic acid is a highly hydrophilic polysaccharide found in all living cells that attracts and binds more than 1,000 times its weight in water. Hyaluronic acid  is  chemically,  physically,  and  biologically  similar  in  all species.  Because of this, there is no reason for allergy testing, 4 which was one of the biggest drawbacks of bovine collagen products.  Second,  studies  show  that  Restylane  lasts  longer than Zyplast. The longevity of Zyplast has long been a problem for patients and injectors. Although the product was easy to use  and  produced  acceptable  results,  its  effects  lasted  only several months in most patients, whereas some studies showed that Restylane can last up to 8 months. 5,6 One of the reasons for  extended  longevity  with  the  hyalurons  (hyaluronic  acid fillers)  is  a  process  called isovolemic  degradation. Normally, collagen fi  llers are simply phagocytized and degraded, and this causes a decrease in volume. In this process, water is drawn into the fi  ller of the hydrophilic molecule as the fi  ller degrades. In this way, fi  ller volume is retained longer as more water is continually drawn into the fi  ller molecule (Figure 29-1). 7", "book_name": "Fonseca ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL - Volume III", "page_number": "641", "id": 0}, {"page_content": "superfi  cial  lines,  whereas  CosmoPlast  is  cross-linked  and  is used primarily in the treatment of more pronounced wrinkles.

Medical conditions such as  thyroid  disease,  heart  disease,  liver  dysfunction,  bleeding disorders, and seasonal allergy and edema must be ruled out.\nOnce  the  history  has  been  completed,  a  step-by-step approach must be used to evaluate the lids. With all esthetic procedures, one must fi  rst obtain an overall view of the entire face  before  focusing  on  the  specifi  c  area  of  concern.  This overall image often provides a tremendous amount of information about the aging process that can be relayed to the patient during the evaluation.\nAfter this overall assessment has been performed, the clinician must evaluate the position of the brows and the forehead. If  the  patient  appears  to  have  dermatochalasia  of  the  upper lids,  one must ascertain that the dermatochalasia is not due to brow ptosis. If this is the case, performing an upper blepharoplasty in the presence of brow ptosis will only cause further descent  of  the  brow,  leading  to  an  unesthetic  result.  If  the brow appears ptotic, the patient may need to undergo a brow elevation (e.g., endoscopic, open, browpexy) prior to performance of the upper blepharoplasty. 18 Specifi  c  measurements are used to identify an ideal brow for males and females. Generally, an eyebrow has three parts: medial, apex, and tail. In a male, all three regions should be aligned with the supraorbital rim.  A  masculine  brow  is  one  with  little  elevation  in  its apex or tail. On the other hand, a female brow should exhibit slight  elevation  medially  (0  to  2 mm  compared  with  the underlying supraorbital rim), should be elevated to 10 mm at the  apex  (compared  with  the  underlying  supraorbital  rim), and  then  should  descend  slightly  toward  the  tail  aspect.

Typically, the supratarsal crease is found about 9 to 11 mm above the lid margin. This can be measured with a ruler while the brow is elevated with one hand and the patient is asked to look downward. If the supratarsal crease is signifi  cantly greater than 9 to 11 mm, one must consider the possibility of levator disinsertion from the septum. With the brow kept in its normal position, excess upper lid skin must be pinched between two fi  ngers so the amount of dermatochalasia can be determined. This can be graded subjectively from 0 to 3, with 3 representing signifi  cant hooding whereby excess lid  skin  is  sitting  on  top  of  the  lashes,  and  0  signifying  no redundant tissue. The upper lid fat pads also must be assessed. Usually, one fi  nds a prolapsed medial fat pad in the upper lid, especially  in  an  older  patient.  Another  important  consideration is the potential presence of lid ptosis (blepharoptosis). 7,19 This can be identifi  ed in two ways. The fi  rst way is to measure the palpebral fi  ssure-the distance between the central aspect of the upper lid and the central aspect of the lower lid-with the  patient  gazing  while  in  a  primary  position.  This  width should measure almost 10 mm  bilaterally. A  signifi  cant decrease in palpebral fi  ssure width should raise the suspicion for upper lid ptosis.

This is the distance between the light refl  ex in the patient's cornea and the central upper lid margin, with the patient's eyes  in  the  primary  position  of  gaze.  The  upper  lid  usually covers 2 mm of the superior limbus of the iris (Figure 25-15). The  normal  MRD-1  measures  about  4  to  5 mm;  a  smaller number may indicate upper lid ptosis.

The depressor supercilii is important because it is superfi  cial to the corrugator and is easily treated inadvertently with Botox. It is also important because it lies  behind  the  corrugator  during  a  brow  lift  and can be transected via aggressive dissection through the corrugator muscle.

Patients who may be allergic to any of the components should not receive Botox. Botox is a category C drug that is not recommended during pregnancy. It is not known whether Botox is secreted in breast milk.  Patients  with  neuromuscular  disorders  (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, Eaton-Lambert syndrome) may be extremely sensitive to systemic effects, especially dysphagia.

Some  patients  present  to  have  these lines  injected  individually;  this  can  be  done  with  Restylane Fine  Line,  Juvederm,  Cosmoderm,  and  other  small-particle fillers. The potential problem with this treatment is that it is possible to trade a series of vertical rhytids for a series of 'speed bumps.' This author prefers to treat these lines by making the lip  fuller,  thus  stretching  and  plumping  the  overlying  skin. These  lines  may  be  treated  with  laser  resurfacing  and  with small-unit  Botox  injections.  Placement  of  1  to  2  units  of Botox in two to four areas across the upper (and or lower) lip can assist in mitigating vertical rhytids. Over-treatment of the lips with Botox can lead to disfi  guring and dysfunctional lip paralysis and is not a treatment for novice injectors to perform. The effect of this small amount of Botox is to gently reduce the underlying muscle function that in part causes the rhytids. Only a fi  ne line separates optimum results from dysfunction. It is recommended for treatment to begin with 1 unit administered  to  two  to  four  areas,  and  for  the  patient  to  return  if more is needed. Figure 29-14 shows general areas for Botox injection in the lips when vertical lip rhytids are treated.\nINJECTING ORAL COMMISSURES\nPerioral aging frequently causes depressed triangular areas at each oral commissure. Not only are these depressions unesthetic, they also cause a 'down-turned' smile. This area must be addressed when the lips are treated. One problem is that these depressions represent the convergence of multiple tissue planes, and a signifi  cant amount of fi  ller can be injected here without signifi  cant augmentation. In the author's experience, it  takes at least an entire syringe (one half on each side) to make a difference in the oral commissures (Figure 29-15).", "book_name": "Fonseca ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL - Volume III", "page_number": "648", "id": 3}, {"page_content": "Patient  complaints  of  pain  during  injection  vary  widely.

It is best for patients to avoid aspirin, NSAIDs, and any other medication or herbal supplement that has anticoagulant  properties  for  a  week  or  longer  prior  to  Botox injection.\nOther local complications of Botox result from unintended relaxation  of  specifi  c  muscles  or  excessive  relaxation  of  the treated muscle. Ptosis of the upper eyelid can occur if Botox diffuses to the levator palpebra superioris. This condition can be treated with Iopidine 0.5% eyedrops, which, as an alphaadrenergic agonist, stimulates the sympathetic M\u00fcller's muscle to  contract.  Brow  ptosis  can  occur  if  the  frontalis  muscle  is over-relaxed.  Diplopia  can  result  if  Botox  diffuses  into  the orbit  affecting  the  extraocular  muscles.  If  diplopia  is  signifi  cant, an ophthalmology consultation should be obtained, and consideration may be given to injecting the antagonist of the affected  muscle.

Hilt Tatum in 1975 introduced a technique to increase alveolar  bone  height  that  placed  graft  material  under  the maxillary sinus membrane before placing implants. 10 In 1980, Boyne and James, using the Caldwell-Luc procedure, grafted autogenous  bone  between  the  sinus  membrane  and  antral floor. 11 Smiler and Holmes reported a series of fi  ve successful subantral  grafts  performed  via  a  lateral  window  approach using  porous  hydroxyapatite  alone  as  the  graft  material  in 1987. 12\n\u25a0 BIOLOGIC AND ANATOMIC CONSIDERATIONS\nMORPHOLOGY", "book_name": "Fonseca ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL - Volume I", "page_number": "468", "id": 0}, {"page_content": "A limited buccal osteotomy begins slightly above the sinus floor (Figure 26-29).

Freer elevators or large spoon elevators lift the membrane slightly from the  sinus  fl  oor,  and  dissection  progresses  toward  the  medial wall of the sinus (Figure 26-30).\nThe balloon is checked for leaks by infl  ation with 3 to 4 cc of sterile saline (Figure 26-31).

The  balloon  is  slowly  expanded  with  1.5  to  2.0 cc  of sterile  saline,  and  the  membrane is elevated (Figure 26-32). The balloon is emptied and withdrawn, leaving a cavity bordered by the refl  ected membrane and attached buccal bone, the medial wall of the sinus, and the nonrefl  ected membrane (Figure 26-33).

Some patients may fi  nd this surprising, sinus disease in patients undergoing maxillary osteotomy surprisingly  is  not  greater  than  the  incidence  in  the  general population. 75\nThe nasal mucosa heals with scar, and the specialized ciliated mucosa does not regenerate. If preexisting sinus disease or symptoms are present and sinus mucosal thickening and/or mucopyelocele  are  present,  removal  of  the  diseased  mucosa should be performed conservatively at the time of the osteotomy.  The  nasal  ostium  is  naturally  enlarged  after  Le  Fort  I osteotomy,  and  for  many  patients  sinus  drainage  improves after maxillary osteotomy.\nThe sinus cavity is completely exposed at the time of Le Fort  I  osteotomy.

These early terms were based on observations of the clinical phenotype  that  often  suggested  involvement  of  the  sympathetic nervous  system.  However,  the  link  between  nociceptive neurons and postganglionic sympathetic activity is inconstant, with sympathetic blocks sometimes altering the syndrome at least temporarily and sometimes not. Adrenergic mechanisms in some form do appear to be involved in some of these conditions, but measurements of sympathetic responses have often shown normal results. 149 Two forms have been defi  ned: CRPS I, previously termed refl  ex sympathetic dystrophy, and CRPS II, previously termed causalgia. 1 Both these entities involve spontaneous pain accompanied by allodynia and hyperalgesia that are  not  limited  to  dermatomal  regions.  Additional  signs include edema, abnormal blood fl  ow in the skin, and abnormal sudomotor activity. CRPS I may develop as a consequence of remote trauma or after relatively minor local trauma such as sprains  or  surgery.  These  result  in  minor  or  no  identifi  able nerve  lesions  with  disproportionate  pain.  CRPS  II,  the  less frequent form, is characterized by a substantiated injury to a major nerve and is therefore an NP syndrome by defi  nition. In both of these syndromes there may be clinical evidence to support the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system, in which case the term sympathetically maintained pain is added. This is not, however, a prerequisite for the diagnosis of CRPS. The historical  dependence  on  sympathetic  involvement  for the diagnosis of CRPS has probably prevented the identifi  cation  and  documentation  of  head  and  neck  cases.  Therefore the cases reported have relied on surgical cervical sympathectomy, clonidine, guanethidine, and stellate ganglion blockade to confi  rm CRPS. 150 However, some of the criteria are rarely if ever observed in posttraumatic orofacial pain. For example, trophic  changes  and  atrophy  of  skin  are  unreported  in  the trigeminal region, and motor disturbances are rare.

A staff member should always accompany a waiting patient and engage them in relaxing not medical conversation (Figure 19-3). This author has made a nominal investment in large screen television sets in the main treatment and surgery rooms (Figures 19-4 and 19-5). It is okay to leave a patient unattended  if  he  or  she  has  something  to  do,  and  handing them a remote for the big screen TV can bide time and mitigate the feeling of waiting.\nNothing is more important than a smile. As a result of the stress associated with our career, we must sometimes force a smile, but no physician or employee should ever enter a treatment  room  without  a  smile.  No  other  body  language  is  as reassuring. In addition to smiling, patients like to be touched. Classic  medicine  from  thousands  of  years  ago  talks  of  'the laying  of  the  hands.'  There  is  something  about  appropriate compassionate touching that helps the physician-patient relationship. A hand shake or a pat on the shoulder is sometimes all that is necessary. Unhappy patients that feel rushed through one's offi  ce will frequently say, 'The doctor didn't even touch me.'

Talk to  the  patient  on  the  same  level,  both  physically  (sit  down with the patient) and verbally (use simple language and avoid the use of jargon or acronyms).\nWhen a patient speaks to you, do not interrupt him or her. Aside  from  steering  the  conversation  away  from  something you might need to know, it is just plain rude. Do not anticipate what a patient is trying to say if he is not being clear. Ask him to rephrase the question or repeat it back to him so that you are both sure the right question is being answered.\nOne of the most crucial times for an oral and maxillofacial surgeon to be available to a patient is when a complication or untoward event occurs. Taking the time to sit down with the patient to explain exactly what happened and what the future course will be is critical. Give patients enough time to digest the information, allow them to ask questions, and be available for  any  additional questions they may have. An empathetic and reassuring voice can go a long way to ensuring that the\npatient remains satisfi  ed with his or her care.

These explanations will help the patient appreciate why the practitioner needs information about the whole patient, not just the mouth and face.

Two techniques, silence and open-ended questions, can be used to probe for more information when a patient is vague or unclear or when a potential area of concern emerges as the interview unfolds. The use of silence to gather information is a diffi  cult but valuable skill.

Rezende  et  al. 26 promotes  early  treatment  in  these patients because of psychological and physiologic factors: (1) missing teeth cause prevention of new appositional bone in the vertical dimension, and only the sutural growth between the maxilla and the cranial base affect implant location; (2) alveolar  bone  defects  caused  by  anodontia  reduces  tissue support for eventual removable prostheses; and (3) the absence of teeth and impaired aesthetics and phonetics can be socially damaging.\nThe management of these patients requires  a  multidisciplinary  approach,  which  will  usually  consist  of  a  pediatric dentist,  orthodontist,  prosthodontist,  and  oral  surgeon.  The principal aims of dental treatment are to restore missing teeth and bone, establish a closer to normal vertical dimension, and provide support for the facial soft tissues.\nConventional prosthodontic treatment can be problematic because of the patient's anatomic abnormalities of the teeth (conically shaped) and the alveolar ridge (knife-edged). These abnormalities will result in poor retention and instability of a removable prosthesis.\nThe use of endosseous implants in children with hereditary ectodermal dysplasia appears to be a viable alternative, even though their use in the younger population carries a degree of unpredictability.

Coincidentally the lingual nerve is directly in the path of needle insertion. Furthermore with the mouth wide open during the injection, the lingual nerve becomes more taut, reducing its chance of being defl  ected  by  the  searing  needle.  This  will  lead  to  a  higher likelihood that the needle will penetrate the nerve potentially (1)  severing  nerve  fi  ber;  (2)  damaging  small  blood  vessels located  within  the  epineurium  and  leading  to  intraneural hemorrhage; or  (3)  damaging  connective  tissues  within  the nerve  via  edema.

Strict adherence to surgical treatment algorithms for ID is not always benefi  cial or possible because each patient's underlying disorder and symptoms are unique and must be treated as such. The surgeon must avoid overemphasizing radiographic fi  ndings when determining if arthrotomy will effectively treat the ID  and  not  cause  any  unnecessary  morbidity.

In healthy patients, a stone or other underlying local condition should be suspected. Samples for culture  and  sensitivity  testing  are  obtained  by  milking  the gland when possible, and appropriate antibiotics that are well absorbed  by  salivary  glands  are  prescribed.  Supportive  measures (e.g., fl  uid replacement and analgesics) should be instituted. If acute abscess formation occurs (Figure 26-5), surgical drainage  is  required.  Incisions  should  be  placed  parallel  to facial nerve branches to prevent injury. A preauricular incision with blunt dissection into the abscess using a small hemostat results in a more cosmetic scar and prevents facial nerve damage.\nIn infants and children, abscesses in the parotid region are usually  due  to  hematogenous  spread  of  bacteria  to  parotid lymph nodes. Subsequent suppuration and breakdown of the node cause an abscess that requires drainage. Staphylococci involved in these infections are usually resistant to penicillin. In pediatric patients, cervical lymphadenitis associated with atypical  mycobacteria  may  rarely  affect  the  parotid  lymph nodes  (Figure 26-6). 7\nTuberculosis is another rare cause of parotitis. The infection may be confi  ned to the parotid lymph nodes or may affect the salivary gland parenchyma.\nACUTE SUPPURATIVE INFECTION OF THE SUBMANDIBULAR GLAND\nAcute suppurative infection of the submandibular gland occurs less often than the parotid gland.

This condition is called sialosis.\nThere are a number of diseases characterized by bilateral swelling of the major salivary glands, dry eyes, and xerostomia. The best known is Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, in which the patient also  suffers  from  a  collagen  autoimmune disease, most commonly rheumatoid arthritis. Diagnosis is based on history and examination, but may be confi  rmed by special tests, including antibody profi  les (anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B antibodies) and a salivary gland biopsy to confi  rm the presence of lymphocytic infi  ltration. Although the common site for a biopsy is the lip (involving the removal of three to four minor salivary glands), a parotid gland biopsy is recommended by some authorities. 25 Treatment is symptomatic, with artifi  cial tears and saliva and the use of fl  uoride trays with regular dental follow-up. If the parotid  glands  become very enlarged, they may be removed for improved  cosmesis.  However,  this  is  diffi  cult  surgery because  of  the  fi  brosis  and  microabscesses  present.  Rapid growth of any gland should alert the surgeon to the possibility of lymphomatous change.\nLymphomas may occur in the parotid gland without antecedent Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome or AIDS. In children with AIDS, bilateral lymphocytic infi  ltration of the major glands may be seen.\nXerostomia is a symptom associated with a variety of underlying  disease  states,  including  endocrine  and  metabolic  disorders  and  psychiatric  disease.  The  clinician  should  always obtain  a  list  of  the  patient's  medications  because  sedatives, antidepressants, and antihypertensives are among the common groups of drugs that may cause xerostomia.\nREFERENCES\nHarrison JD: Salivary mucocele, Oral Surg 39:268, 1975.", "book_name": "Fonseca ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL - Volume II", "page_number": "568", "id": 8}], "answer": "According to CHUNK 2, in acute suppurative parotitis, the causative organism is usually Staphylococcus (usually penicillin resistant) or Streptococcus. While the question specifically asks about acute bacterial sialadenitis, the information provided in the context focuses on acute suppurative parotitis, a condition closely related to sialadenitis.

The rotation and advancement fl  ap technique for cleft lip repair probably is the most widely used operative procedure for the unilateral cleft lip. This cleft lip repair technique was fi  rst introduced in 1955 by Millard.  The 1 markings and measurements used for the Millard rotation and advancement fl  ap procedure are straightforward and allow the incorporation of intraoperative adjustments during the operation. With this 'trim as you go' technique, superior results are routinely achieved.\nThe objectives of unilateral cleft lip repair include (1) approximation of cleft edges without loss of natural landmarks,  (2)  repositioning  of  the  cupid's  bow  into  a  normal position,  (3)  placement  of  incisions  and  scar  along  natural\nlines, (4) muscle repair and alignment, (5) balancing of the alar bases, and (6) an equal columella bilaterally.

His or her recommendations regarding timing of treatment, based on growth, should be considered carefully when surgical interventions are planned. By age 4 or 5 the effects of surgical scarring on growth may become apparent. Although techniques have improved, surgically treated patients with clefts have a tendency toward both anterior and posterior crossbites, which are less frequently seen in patients with untreated clefts. A number of acceptable treatment strategies may be used, but of paramount concern is to maximize outcomes  while  minimizing  the  time  in  orthodontic  treatment.

The intraoral blade (Stryker,  Kalamazoo,  Mich.)  and  the  Bauer  and  LavasseurMerrill lighted retractors (Walter Lorenz) are helpful in executing the procedure correctly. The Bauer retractors are placed in the sigmoid notch, whereas the Lavasseur-Merrill retractor lies along the posterior border of the mandible. It has a bend in it such that when the intraoral saw blade is placed on the retractor, the osteotomy  is located approximately  7 mm forward of the posterior border of the mandible. This reduces the  chance  of  making  a  subcondylar  osteotomy  (osteotomy too  close  to  the  posterior  border)  or  damaging  the  inferior alveolar nerve (osteotomy close to or through the lingula). 76 An  inadvertent  subcondylar  osteotomy  extends  from  the sigmoid notch to the posterior ramus (an oblique subcondylar osteotomy), making the proximal segment into a subcondylar segment of varying size (Figure 20-13).

Lower  eyelid  malpositions  are  graded mild when there is slight eversion of the cilia inferiorly with or  without  scleral  show,  moderate  when  the  lid  margin  is everted with lower eyelid descent and scleral show, and severe when frank ectropion is present. Mild ectropion and moderate ectropion  usually  resolve  over  time  with  gentle  massage  of the  lid.

Through  these  drainage  pathways  and volume  expansion,  some  degree  of  protection  is  provided against critical increases in intraorbital pressures.\nA penetrating globe injury must be ruled out when examination reveals herniation of fat through an eyelid laceration, violation of palpebral conjunctiva (inner lid inspection), or an irregular (ovoid or pointing) pupil (see Figure 13-9). Blunt globe trauma can result in globe perforation, which typically occurs in the sclera just proximal to the insertion of the rectus muscles onto the globe. These insertions are 5 to 7 mm proximal to the edge of the limbus. It is at these locations that the sclera is the weakest.

Highenergy fractures often result in more severe displacement and comminution of the body of the zygoma. These injuries commonly require orbital reconstruction. 22\nThe main reason not to treat zygomatic fractures surgically is  the  clinical  absence  of  functional  and  aesthetic  compromise. 22,89 Another consideration is the degree of vision in the unaffected eye. Visceral and neurologic damage always takes precedence over a fractured facial bone.

Waiting for residual edema to resolve, approximately 2 weeks, is usually acceptable. This delay allows time for adequately assessing and planning the case; in addition, fi  ndings associated  with  the  injury  manifest  themselves  during  this time.

As the impacted teeth develop, the surrounding follicular sac in most patients maintains its original size, but in some cases may undergo cystic degeneration and develop into a dentigerous cyst or keratocyst.

Retrobulbar  bleeds and  blindness  are  the  gravest  complications  of  upper  and lower  blepharoplasty.  Meticulous  hemostasis  is  mandatory during surgery to decrease the chance of postoperative bleeding. Intense unilateral pain and progressive proptosis and chemosis  are  hallmarks  of  a  retrobulbar  bleed  that  requires emergent attention in the form of an inferior canthotomy and cantholysis  to  decrease  intraocular  pressure  and  evacuate clots. If this pressure is allowed to increase, optic nerve ischemia can occur, and this may cause irreversible visual disturbance. The canthotomy and cantholysis should be kept open for 24 to 48 hours.

To achieve an excellent result, blepharoplasty of upper 3 and lower lids demands a clear understanding of the appropriate  preoperative  diagnosis  and  regional  anatomy,  surgical execution, and management of postoperative complications. Perhaps more important than the aforementioned concepts, it is paramount to remember that any cosmetic surgical procedure  requires  an  appreciation  of  what  the  patient  wants. Discrepancies between what a practitioner wants to treat and what the patient wants to have treated can lead to suboptimal results. Often, a patient presents to the clinician's offi  ce with a specifi  c  complaint regarding the appearance of the periorbital region. Given the vast amount of information available on the Internet, most patients can be quite focused about their concerns. Considering the complex anatomy of the periorbital region, the clinician must formulate a clear diagnosis and a treatment plan that corresponds to the patient's concerns. For example, a patient may not be satisfi  ed with the appearance of the upper eyelids and may complain that she has diffi  culty applying makeup to the upper lids simply because they are so sagging. This patient may present for what she perceives as an eyelid  issue.  Often,  however,  the  patient  suffers  from  brow ptosis and may actually need a brow lift to address the sagging eyelids  (Figure  25-2).  Therefore,  proper  preoperative  communication and treatment planning are absolutely necessary for satisfactory results and a happy patient. The purpose of this chapter  is  to  familiarize  the  reader  with  commonly  used nomenclature,  surgical  anatomy,  patient  selection,  surgical execution, and potential complications associated with upper and lower lid blepharoplasty.\n\u25a0 NOMENCLATURE\nAs is common with many esthetic procedures, multiple phrases and terms are used to describe the appearance of the upper and lower lids. This sometimes can lead to confusion for the novice surgeon.

Minor issues include chemosis, bruising, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and blurred  vision.  All  of  these  issues  are  transient  and  resolve within the fi  rst 7 to 14 days after surgery.\nMore serious complications include those associated with esthetics, lid position, and function of the eyes. Esthetic complications  involve  persistence  of  orbital  fat  pads,  excess  or redundant skin, and asymmetry between the two sides and can be prevented by precise preoperative assessment. The lateral fat  pad  of  the  lower  lid  usually  is  the  most  diffi  cult  pad  to access. Most under-resections are associated with this particular pad. Persistent postoperative excess skin can be prevented by measuring the patient while the patient is sitting. When the patient lies supine, the brows are raised; in this position, only some of the dermatochalasia can be removed, leading to under-removal of excess skin. Asymmetries usually occur as the  result  of  unequal  removal  of  fat  and  skin  from  the  two sides.  All  fat  and  excised  skin  should  be  kept  and  labeled throughout the procedure to ensure equal amounts of resection  (assuming  that  no  asymmetries  were  noted  preoperatively).  Asymmetries  can  be  caused  by  the  position  of  the supratarsal crease or incision. It is imperative that the distance between the lashes and the crease (incision) be measured if any doubt exists regarding potential asymmetry between the two sides.", "book_name": "Fonseca ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL - Volume III", "page_number": "605", "id": 7}, {"page_content": "General  complications  that  arise  from  the  manipulation  of soft tissue are numerous and can include dehiscence, hematoma or seroma, lymphedema, and scarring. With respect to the surgical approaches to the zygoma through the lower lid, other, more specifi  c complications can arise, including vertical shortening of the lower lid, ectropion, and entropion.\nIf they become large enough, hematomas and seromas can be  managed by decompression with a needle and a syringe. Lymphedema subsides over time, especially if the lower lid is supported in its proper position. Dehiscence of a wound may require  nothing  more  than  observation  unless  the  defect becomes  very  large;  in  such  cases  the  wound  may  require packing or, if indicated, resuturing.\nVertical shortening of the lower lid may occur when the scar  contracts  between  the  tarsal  plate  and  the  periosteum, thereby shortening the orbital septum. This complication can be prevented by providing superior support of the lower lid for several days (or until gross edema has resolved) after surgery. The simplest preventative method is the Frost suture. 61 This technique closes the eye, supports the lower lid, aids in the dissipation  of  lid  edema,  and  allows  postoperative  examination of the globe and measurement of vision. Splinting of the lower eyelid by suturing antibiotic-laden, lubricated gauze to the lower eyelid after surgery has also been described. 38\nEctropion and entropion are distressing problems, although most cases are self-limited.

A  bulbous nasal tip typically is the result of large strong lower lateral cartilages that often have a bidomal configuration.  An  increased  angle  of  divergence  of  the  medial crura  as  seen  from  the  basal  view  may  also  contribute  to  a broad nasal tip. In some cases a broad nasal tip can be seen in patients with weak cartilage and thick fi  brofatty skin in the nasal tip region. Thick skin with weak lower lateral cartilage is typically seen in Asian or African-American patients.\nAs previously mentioned, there are three principle methods to  address  shape  of  the  nasal  tip:  suture  modifi  cation,  dome division (interrupted strip technique), and cartilage grafting.\nSuture  modifi  cation  is  done  after  removal  of  a  cephalic strip of cartilage. 31 A transdomal horizontal mattress suture is placed in the region of the intermediate crus to narrow the dome.  This  is  done  separately  for  each  dome.  If  additional narrowing is needed, the transdomal sutures are tied to each other. This interlocked pair of transdomal sutures is termed a double dome technique (see Figure 24-20). It is important to not bring the domes together so tightly that the normal angle of divergence between the intermediate crura is obliterated. The domes should be separated by 1 to 3 mm in order to maintain the tip defi  ning points. Another suture technique is to place an interdomal suture, which can improve tip symmetry and strength  as  well  as  decrease  the  interdomal  distance.  This involves  placement  of  an  interrupted  suture  in  the  medial crura 3 to 4 mm inferior to the domes.\nThe  dome  division  or  interrupted  strip  technique  can provide dramatic narrowing in bulbous nasal tips by allowing the lateral crus to assume a more medial position.

As they grow and become no longer dependent on creating oral suction to ingest food, respiratory efforts may change, but nasal breathing predominates as the primary mode during periods of non-exertion. During exercise and other activities that  increase  oxygen  demand,  respiratory  patterns  become more oral.\nThe nasal cavity is divided in the midline by the septum and is surrounded superiorly and laterally by the cartilaginous and bony framework. The turbinates project from the lateral walls of the nasal cavity to warm and humidify air as well as control the amount of air passing through the nose. In most individuals the predominate mode of respiration typically is nasal. The inferior turbinate is covered by specialized mucosa that  engorges  and  swells  cyclically  on  a  daily  basis.  Septal deviations, spurs, and enlarged turbinates contribute to nasal airway resistance. In the normal nose the greatest contributors to  nasal  resistance  are  the  nostril  openings  and  the  liminal valve, which is the angle formed by the insertion of the lateral cartilage to the nasal septum. When septal deviations, septal spurring,  or  turbinate  enlargement  occurs,  nasal  resistance increases and thus respiratory mode must change.\nWith  the  introduction  of  superior  repositioning  of  the maxilla,  alarm  developed  about  the  potential  effects  of  this procedure  on  the  ability  to  conduct  nasal  respiration.  The concerning  logic  was  that  the  volume  of  the  nasal  cavity reduces as the maxilla is raised and that the reduction of nasal volume increases nasal resistance, forcing the respiratory mode to  change  from  predominately  nasal  to  predominately  oral. Although the logic makes sense, the reality is that the ability to breathe through the nose improves after maxillary osteotomy in most patients. What logic fails to appreciate is that the total resistance of the nasal cavity is the rate limiter to nasal respiration, not just the volume of the nasal vault.\n\u25a0 NASAL AIRWAY RESISTANCE", "book_name": "Fonseca ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL - Volume III", "page_number": "85", "id": 5}, {"page_content": "If aggressive deprojection is required, the medial crura can be transected horizontally, overlapped, and sutured with horizontal mattress sutures. The same can be done to the lateral crura if the tip needs increased rotation as well. Crural excision maintains the natural shape of the tip at the domes and is  therefore  preferred  to  excising  segments  of  the  dome  and suturing them back together.\nSometimes after  signifi  cant  deprojection  of  the  tip  there may be a relative fl  aring of the alar base and increased colu- mellar show. The alar fl  aring can be treated with conservative alar base resection; however, if this was not planned preoperatively,  it  is  best  to  reevaluate  this  once  swelling  subsides  in several weeks. A minor alar base resection can be done using local  anesthesia  at  a  later  date  if  needed  in  these  circumstances (Figure 24-23).

The cartilage can be stacked in layers and sutured in place with 6-0 Prolene.

The transdomal sutures can be sutured to one another to further narrow the nasal tip. In cases when tip shape is adequate but narrowing is  required, a single suture placed between the domes to bring them closer together can be done; this is termed an interdomal suture.", "book_name": "Fonseca ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL - Volume III", "page_number": "575", "id": 7}, {"page_content": "Increasing tip rotation can be done in a number of ways. Simply reducing the dorsal hump of the nose will make the nasal tip appear more rotated. Removing a cephalic strip of cartilage from the lower lateral cartilages will result in increased tip  rotation  (Figure  24-24).  An  intercartilaginous  incision used in closed rhinoplasty techniques disrupts the scroll and will result in a mild increase in tip rotation. Resecting a small triangular  piece  of  caudal  septum  near  the  anterior  septal angle will allow the lower lateral cartilages to rotate further. Transecting, overlapping, and resuturing the lateral crura with 6-0 Prolene will effectively shorten the two limbs of the tripod and  increased  the  tip  rotation.  Maneuvers  such  as  this  are aggressive and should be reserved for only select situations. It is  generally preferable to use less destructive techniques and preserve the cartilaginous support of the nose. Cartilage grafts, such as the shield graft, can also be used to create the illusion of increased tip rotation. Finally, augmentation of the premaxillary  region  may  give  the  illusion  of  increased  tip  rotation. Premaxillary  defi  ciency  is  typically  seen  more  frequently  in Asian or African-American patients. The augmentation may be performed with materials such as hydroxyapatite or expanded polytetrafl  uoroethylene (ePTFE).\nDecreasing tip rotation occurs with many of the techniques described earlier to decrease tip projection. Additional derotation  can  be  done  by  trimming  the  caudal  septum  near  the anterior  nasal  spine  or  by  augmenting  the  nasal  dorsum  to create the illusion of decreased tip rotation.\nFIGURE 24-23.

The fi  rst scenario occurs when there is normal intermolar  width  but  the  intercanine  dimension  is  narrow owing to collapse of the lesser segment. This requires the use of an appliance with the ability to hold the transverse width in the posterior maxilla and create expansion anteriorly with a quad helix (Figure 40-1, A ). The second scenario typically requires the placement of a hyrax rapid palatal expander. In this scenario a posterior crossbite exists in the molar and/or premolar region. Patients with posterior crossbites frequently have large anterior collapse of the lesser segment, necessitating modifi  cation of the expander (Figure 40-1, B ).\nDifferential expansion in a patient with a cleft is challenging  for  many  reasons.  There  is  scar  rather  than  bone  across\nthe  palate,  which  allows  quick  but  less  predictable  movements. This leads to less control of the segments and dental midlines. If incisors are present, brackets may also be placed to assist with midline control, as well as to treat rotations and anterior crossbites. The orthodontist must avoid tooth movement (especially roots) toward the cleft site, and on occasion orthodontic treatment with brackets and wire must be delayed until after bone grafting. When the maxillary arch form and crossbites are corrected, the cleft defect will be widened and the alveolar fi  stula made larger. This will typically create more air escape and fl  uid regurgitation and may worsen speech temporarily. Speech improves after grafting is complete, and the appliance  can  be  removed.  It  is  important  to  discuss  these issues carefully with the parents before initiating treatment.\nCOMPREHENSIVE PHASE II ORTHODONTICS", "book_name": "Fonseca ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL - Volume III", "page_number": "819, 820", "id": 1}, {"page_content": "In patients with bilateral cleft lip and palate, similar dysmorphologies  are  present;  however,  additional  dental  and skeletal discrepancies may also be present (Box 41-2).

Although sibilant distortion errors and articulation is expected to improve in the patient who has surgical correction  of  malocclusion,  reduction  of  hypernasality  after maxillary advancement is a paradox. This fi  nding is explained by  the  altered  dynamics  of  the  sphincter  that  result  from maxillary advancement surgery. Stretching of the marginally functional  pharyngeal  fl  ap  may  improve  the  velopharyngeal mechanism  enough  to  allow  for  improved  speech  in  some patients.

Watzke et al 38 reported an increase  of  the  velopharyngeal  port  size  in  25%  of  patients with cleft palate undergoing maxillary advancement.

Every patient's ability to compensate for the changes in anatomy as a result of maxillary advance- ment  is different and  unpredictable. Interestingly, some patients who have pharyngeal fl  aps in place demonstrate continued improvement in velopharyngeal function after maxillary advancement.

As indicated by Sloan, pharyngeal fl  aps and sphincter pharyngoplasty are perhaps the two most commonly used procedures. 72 During pharyngeal fl  ap surgery a superiorly-based fl  ap of the posterior pharyngeal wall is  released and sutured to the velum.

This  concave  portion  of  the temporal bone is termed the mandibular or glenoid fossa. The skeletal surfaces of the joint space are lined with specialized endothelial cells. These cells along with synovial tissue in the retrodiscal region produce synovial fl  uid. This fl  uid lubricates the joint during function and provides nutrients to this relatively avascular space.  The articular disk separates the con3 dylar head from the glenoid fossa, forming superior and inferior joint spaces. The disk is composed of dense fi  brous connective tissue  and  is  attached  to  both  the  condylar  head  and  the temporal bone by the capsular ligament.\nLIGAMENTS\nThe collateral discal ligaments tightly attach the articular disk to the condylar head both medially and laterally.

Habits should also be assessed to determine if the etiology of facial pain arises from parafunctional habits such as  repetitive  jaw  motion  or  extreme  jaw  forces  from  gum chewing or clenching, respectively.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY RELATED TO THE FACIAL PAIN PATIENT", "book_name": "Fonseca ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL - Volume II", "page_number": "976", "id": 1}, {"page_content": "| Feature                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Feature                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Paroxysmal attacks of pain lasting from a fraction of a second to 2 minutes                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Paroxysmal attacks of pain lasting from a fraction of a second to 2 minutes                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Between attacks there is usually no pain, but some atypical patients have low-grade background pain or longer-lasting attacks.

However, the jaws are an uncommon site for metastases, and the condyle is an even less frequent location. In  a  review  of  390  cases  of  metastatic  tumors  to  the  jaws, Hirshberg et al 198 reported that 81% occurred in the mandible, but  only  11  cases  (3.5%)  involved  the  condyle.  They  also noted that overall there was a female preponderance, probably accounting for the fact that the breast was the most prevalent primary tumor site. Other reported primary sites with metastases to the condyle have included lung, prostate, liver, pancreas, uterus, rectum, and the skin of the toe. One particularly unusual report involved a testicular teratoma with metastases to both condyles. 199\nThe  most  prevalent  presentation  of  metastases  to  the condyle was TMJ dysfunction, but a pathologic fracture may also be found. Although in most cases the patient has a known primary lesion, in some series condylar metastasis was the fi  rst sign of a neoplasm in as many as half of the patients. Unfortunately,  patients  with  these  metastases  have  a  very  poor prognosis, and the treatment is generally palliative.\nHypotheses  regarding  the  paucity  of  metastases  to  the condyle include: the scant amount of red marrow; the separate  blood  supply  from  the  circular  penetrating  branches  of the maxillary and superfi  cial temporal arteries; the slow circulation; and limiting osseous plate, which shuts off the condylar marrow cavity from the spongiosa of the rest of the mandible.\nOTHER TUMORS\nMany other tumors have been described as occurring within the condyle.

For the skin paddle to survive, it requires a blood supply, which in this case, would need to traverse the muscular unit of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is a common principle in myocutaneous flaps, where the skin island receives its blood supply from the underlying muscle. The other options are not supported by the provided context and are less likely to be accurate based on general medical principles. Option A is incorrect because sacrificing the spinal accessory nerve can result in significant morbidity, including shoulder dysfunction. Option C is incorrect because while the sternocleidomastoid myocutaneous flap can be used for head and neck reconstruction, its reliability for anterior floor of mouth defects is not established in the provided context. Option D is incorrect because radiation can cause fibrosis in muscles, including the sternocleidomastoid muscle."}]
