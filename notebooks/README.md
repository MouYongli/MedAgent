# Notebooks

The purpose of the listed [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install) is to:
- Rapidly prototype and prepare studies required for the project.
- Suggest and experiment with visualizations for the evaluation.
- Interact with data directly (currently via MongoDB), before fully integrating with the backend.

Access to the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) is **currently NOT done via backend calls**. This will be refactored step by step.
- A separate document collection is used for these experiments to avoid interfering with the main system with the name `nb_document_store`


What you'll find in this README
- Overview of the current notebooks and their purpose.
- How to execute the notebooks.
- TODOs for translating notebook logic into the production system (e.g., the frontend).
